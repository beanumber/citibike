# citibike
R package based on ETL framework to interface with NYC CitiBike data

`citibike` is a R package that contains NYC CitiBike trip data from [CitiBike website](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/fhrw-4uyv), and it allows users to upload multiple years of monthly citibike trip data to a local SQL database. 

CitiBike updates New York City citibike data once per season, so users can get access to trip information from 2013-07 to 2016-05.

This package uses the [etl](http://github.com/beanumber/etl) database framework.

Please see [the vignette](https://github.com/beanumber/citibike/blob/master/vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd) to get started.
